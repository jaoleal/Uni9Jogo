# Godot Game project

## About and Tech Stack

The Game will be made with Godot(The best game-engine that exist) with [Rust Bindings]((https://godot-rust.github.io/)).
the relationship betwenn rust and gaming is just beginning, and i'll make part of that.

### Game Concept
  I'm a big fan of Super Mario World, i did all the 96 exits btw. Looking to it simple concept, jump run fly and kill some koopas, i got myself inspired to do something similar to a simple project. A Platformer but with the modern concepts of platforming games, something with more life and movement, just like: Celeste; DKC: Tropical Freeze; Rayman Origins; that are games that enherit the Super Mario World mechanics.

### Game history
  NotSteve found itself on another world just like the game that he played in his infancy, but it's corrupted by some evil company called FromHardware that ruined his childhood's favorite game making it so hard that onyl have true nerds playing on it. Hi's personal mission now is to find the developer that changed the game and destroy him.

  **This is for educational purposes**, i'll not sell this game or make some kind of money of it.

### Technical
  i'll write something when i have something done
